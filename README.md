# PCOS-detection-using-Machine-Learning
### Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), is a hormonal disorder that occurs among women in their reproductive age. It has effective conflicts throughout this gynecological disorder, as it affects one in ten women at an early age. 
### This project includes a detection model of PCOS using various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and Decision Tree. Among all these algorithms, Random Forest has highest accuracy for the model.
